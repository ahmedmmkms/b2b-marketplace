âœ¦ Based on my analysis of the project files, here's what progress is missing compared to the original plan:

  Missing Progress from Original Plan

  Looking at the current state, the project has made substantial progress but is missing several key elements from the original
  P4_Dossier.md sprint plan:

  1. Incomplete Domain Modules
  While the backend domain structure exists, many modules are incomplete:
   - Search Module: Partially implemented but lacks Elasticsearch/OpenSearch integration
   - RFQ/Quote Module: Basic structure exists but missing vendor console and comparison features
   - Orders Module: Core structure present but payment gateway integration incomplete
   - Invoicing/VAT Module: Missing VAT engine and invoice sequencing
   - Loyalty Module: Framework exists but tier engine not implemented
   - Wallet/Credit Module: Basic structure but credit controls not implemented

  2. Missing Core Features
   - Feature Flag System: Not fully implemented (mentioned in TODOs but not operational)
   - Multi-language Support: Arabic/RTL partially implemented but not comprehensive
   - Observability Stack: Basic logging exists but full monitoring/tracing not implemented
   - Security Features: RBAC/ABAC framework referenced but not fully implemented

  3. Infrastructure Gaps
   - Microservice Architecture: Still monolithic, not split into separate services as planned
   - Caching Layer: Redis mentioned but not fully integrated
   - Advanced CI/CD: Basic pipeline works but advanced deployment strategies missing
   - Synthetic Monitoring: Planned but not implemented

  4. Testing & Quality
   - Comprehensive Test Suite: Unit/integration tests exist but end-to-end testing incomplete
   - Performance Testing: Benchmarks defined but not fully implemented
   - Accessibility Testing: i18n/RTL support partial but full a11y audit missing

  5. Documentation & Governance
   - Changelog Automation: Basic versioning but automated changelog updates missing
   - API Documentation: OpenAPI contracts mentioned but full SDK generation incomplete
   - Governance Policies: Feature flags and configuration management partially implemented

  The project has a solid foundation but needs to complete the transition from monolithic architecture to modular services and
  implement the advanced features planned in sprints 1-6 of the original dossier.
