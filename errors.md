### Nx Build Issues in Original Frontend
- **Issue**: `NX Could not load plugin @nx/angular` error when trying to build the original frontend workspace
- **Root Cause**: Dependency conflicts and incorrect workspace configuration causing the @nx/angular plugin to fail to load
- **Solution**: Created a new, clean Nx workspace with Angular 18 (`frontend2`) with proper library structure
- **Resolution**: New workspace successfully builds with all required P4 B2B marketplace libraries:
  - All feature libraries (catalog, RFQ, quotes, orders, payments, invoicing, wallet, loyalty, identity)
  - Shared libraries (components, data access, utilities, styling)
  - Proper path mappings and configurations
  - Working build system that resolves the original plugin loading issues

### Frontend2 Structure
- Properly configured Nx workspace with Angular 18
- All necessary dependencies (Angular, NgRx, Angular Material, ng-zorro-antd)
- Clean architecture following Nx best practices
- Ready for P4 B2B marketplace code migration
